## To-Do:
	1) Add status bar:
		-restart button
		-who's turn
		-roll dice button
		-dice images w/ animation
		-end turn button
	2) Add backend/algorithms:
		-check for valid moves
		-roll dice
		-move piece-moving function to backend

## Fixes:
1) get bottom-board uls to align bottom

## Additional features:
1) integrate usernames
2) undo moves (push positions object onto positions history array and revert to past object (have to credit back roll as well, don't let it revert too far))
3) doubling cube
